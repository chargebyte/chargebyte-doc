Introduction nymea
==================
A nymea installation requires 2 parts. The first part is the nymea:core. This must be installed on
Charge Control C. Q: Should we mention other platforms, too? Or is this description only for CCC?
The second part is the nymea:app on the devices that are used to control nymea:core. This can be all
on the same device where nymea:core is installed, or distributed across multiple devices like
mobile phones, tablets and laptops. 
Both parts have to be in the same network.
