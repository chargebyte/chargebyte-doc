Introduction
============

Thank you very much for your trust. We are happy that you have chosen our Charge Control platform to
operate your eMobility charging solution. This User Guide will help you to understand all features
of our product and configure them properly to fit your and your customer’s requirements best.

Product Description
-------------------

Charge Control C is an IEC 61851 and ISO 15118 compliant charging controller for Electric
Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). For communication between EVSE and PEV it supports Control Pilot, 
Proximity Pilot as well as PWM signaling including Green PHY communication.

The board is also capable of controlling and sensing different kind of actuators and sensors like
LED, relays, contactors and RCDs through its digital I/Os. It comes with the standard interfaces to
be connected to electric meters, RFID devices and different kinds of actuators and sensors.

Charge Control C is provided with a Linux-Yocto operating system. The installed software is based on
EVerest, an open source software stack for EV charging infrastructure. EVerest itself is based on a
modular architecture that allows scalability according to your needs e.g., adding your own
application as an EVerest module. For more information about EVerest, please visit the
`EVerest GitHub project <https://github.com/EVerest/EVerest>`_.

Charge Control C is currently available in three different hardware variants
(Charge Control C 100, 200 and 300) that are suitable for different complexities of
charging stations.
